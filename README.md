# adass2018-tcgaia

This repository contains the source code for Mark Taylor's
poster contribution "TOPCAT and Gaia" to the ADASS 2018 conference.

It contains LaTeX source code, a makefile, and graphics files for
some of the figures.  More interestingly, the makefile also contains
all the commands needed to generate some of the other figures:

1. STILTS commands to download required data from VO services
2. STILTS commands to turn those data files into graphics files

This repository is provided in the interests of transparency,
and also as an example of the things that you can do with STILTS.
